# Hotel Database Management System

## Introduction

For this project, my colleague and I modeled and built a Database Management System for a fictitious hotel chain. This system is capable of tracking various information regarding hotels, rooms, and customers. These include a customer's recent booking history, a manager's ability to place Room Repair Requests, and the ability for all clients to book a room. A description of all the functionalities of client interface can be found in this file.


To complete the client interface, we used the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) tool and the Command Line Interface (CLI). A template of the Java User Interface code was given to us by Dr. Vassilis Tsotras in order to accelerate the setup process. This includes creating a class that defines an embedded SQL utility class that is designed to work with PostgreSQL JDBC drivers. The rest of the functionality was completed by my colleague and I.
